1.Salary by Sex:
From the plot it is clear to see that the number of men that earn more than 50K is much higher than the women.

2.Salary by Maritual status:
From the plot it is clear that those who make more than 50K are more likely to be married than to be single.
In my opinion this was an interesting fact as i thought that it would be the single people who make more money.

3.Salary by Education:
From the plot it is clear that people who have a doctorate, professional school or master are more likely to earn above 50K 
as compared to others. 
This fact came as no surprise.
